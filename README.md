### About AfterHours

AfterHours is a MinecraftForge mod based on the original AfterHours support mod that was created for my custom mod-pack, AfterHours aims to be a mod that brings useful utilities to the multiplayer side of Minecraft. The basis for this mod the concept in Minecraft that past bedrock there exists a "Void", hence the name "void fog" (for the gray smoke your see when you are near to bedrock), and you as a player will learn to tap into the Void. Initial premise is that upon the realization that the combination of ender pearls and glowstone dust (the end + the nether) you can unlock the power of the Void. 

### Credits

So many people to thank for this mod actually coming to fruition. Without the use of the plentiful resources provided by the following list of sites/people I would not know nearly as much about modding as I currently do. The list is in the order in which I was made aware of each resource.
